# CodinGame-Bot

**NOTICE: I forgot to build the NPE fix and publish it. Since I donâ€™t have access to my computer, the previous version is currently running. Only usernames that can be matched exactly will work**

Discord HackWeek: bot for [CodinGame](https://www.codingame.com/)

CodinGame does not have an official API, nor is their unofficial API documented, so a LOT of time was spent reverse-engineering it.

**The developers are OK with this as long as requests are not spammed**

One command: profile

The prefix is a mention

Download jarfile and view run instructions via the releases page.
